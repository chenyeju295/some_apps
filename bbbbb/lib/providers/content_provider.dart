        content: '''# Basic Diving Safety Rules

## Never Hold Your Breath
The most important rule in scuba diving is to never hold your breath. As you ascend, the air in your lungs expands due to decreasing pressure. If you hold your breath, this expansion can cause serious lung injuries.

## Plan Your Dive and Dive Your Plan
Always plan your dive before entering the water:
- Maximum depth
- Bottom time
- Air consumption rate
- Emergency procedures

## Check Your Equipment
Before every dive, perform a thorough equipment check:
- BCD inflation and deflation
- Regulator breathing test
- Gauge readings
- Mask and fins fit

## Use the Buddy System
Never dive alone. Your dive buddy is your safety backup:
- Stay within sight of each other
- Know each other's hand signals
- Practice emergency procedures together

## Monitor Your Air Supply
Check your air gauge frequently:
- Start ascent with 50 bar (700 psi) remaining
- Surface with 30 bar (500 psi) minimum
- Never share air unless it's an emergency

Remember: When in doubt, don't dive. Your safety is more important than any dive.''',

If you lose sight of your buddy:
1. Look around for 1 minute maximum
2. Make some noise (tank banging)
3. If not found, surface slowly
4. Meet at the predetermined surface location

## Mask Flooding
1. Remain calm - you can breathe through your regulator
2. Tilt your head back slightly
3. Press top of mask against forehead
4. Exhale through nose to clear water

## Regulator Free-Flow
1. Don't panic - you have plenty of air
2. Turn off the air flow if possible
3. Breathe from the side of your mouth
4. Signal buddy and begin ascent

## Cramp Relief
Leg cramps underwater:
1. Grab your fin tip
2. Pull towards you while straightening leg
3. Massage the cramped muscle
4. Signal buddy if you need assistance

        title: 'Mastering Buoyancy Control',
        content: '''# Mastering Buoyancy Control

Buoyancy control is the most important skill in diving. It affects your air consumption, safety, and enjoyment underwater.

## Understanding Buoyancy

### Three States of Buoyancy
1. **Positive** - You float upward
2. **Negative** - You sink downward  
3. **Neutral** - You neither sink nor float

### Factors Affecting Buoyancy
- **Lung volume** - breathing affects buoyancy
- **Equipment weight** - BCD, weights, tank
- **Wetsuit compression** - decreases with depth
- **Salt vs fresh water** - salt water is denser

## Achieving Perfect Buoyancy

### Initial Weight Check
1. At surface, fully inflate BCD
2. Hold normal breath
3. Float at eye level
4. Deflate BCD completely
5. Should slowly sink

### Fine-Tuning Underwater
- **Add air** to BCD when sinking
- **Release air** when floating up
- **Small adjustments** work best
- **Use breathing** to fine-tune

## Breathing Techniques

### Lung as Buoyancy Control
- **Inhale** - become more buoyant
- **Exhale** - become less buoyant
- **Deep breathing** affects buoyancy more
- **Controlled breathing** maintains stable buoyancy

### Optimal Breathing Pattern
1. **Slow, deep breaths**
2. **Pause briefly** at full inhale
3. **Slow, complete exhale**
4. **Brief pause** before next inhale

## Common Buoyancy Problems

### Over-Weighting
Signs:
- Constantly adding air to BCD
- Rapid descent at start of dive
- Difficulty staying up during safety stop

Solutions:
- Remove 1-2 lbs of weight
- Do proper weight check
- Practice at shallow depth

### Under-Weighting
Signs:
- Can't descend even with empty BCD
- Floating during safety stop
- Struggling to stay down

Solutions:
- Add 1-2 lbs of weight
- Check equipment for trapped air
- Ensure complete BCD deflation

### Poor BCD Control
Signs:
- Yo-yo diving (up and down movement)
- Over-inflating BCD
- Adding large amounts of air

Solutions:
- Make small adjustments only
- Use oral inflator for precision
- Practice in shallow water

## Advanced Buoyancy Skills

### Hovering Motionless
1. Find neutral buoyancy at target depth
2. Relax completely
3. Use only breathing for small adjustments
4. Practice staying motionless for 30 seconds

### Swimming While Neutral
1. Achieve neutral buoyancy
2. Use fins for propulsion only
3. Maintain depth while swimming
4. Adjust for depth changes

### Photography Buoyancy
1. Perfect neutral buoyancy essential
2. Use reef hook in currents
3. Steady breathing for sharp photos
4. Avoid contact with bottom

## Practice Exercises

### Pool Training
1. **Fin pivot** - stay on bottom with fin tips
2. **Hovering** - motionless mid-water
3. **Swimming without hands** - fins only propulsion

### Open Water Practice
1. **Peak performance buoyancy** course
2. **Underwater photography** training
3. **Regular buoyancy** check dives

## Benefits of Good Buoyancy
- **Better air consumption**
- **Reduced marine life disturbance**
- **Improved safety margins**
- **More enjoyable diving**
- **Better underwater photography**
- **Easier wreck penetration**
